The storage sytem considers both Key and Value to be positive integers.\r\n\r\nIn the first step, we implemented a communication between servers that simulates a delay. Step two was built upon step one to implement the Key-Value Store with different consistency models. A central server is used to provide totally ordered broadcast. \r\n\r\n# Features\r\n- Search function that displays the list of servers that store replicas of the key being searched.\r\n- Display function that the key-value pairs stored on the node performing this command.\r\n- Inconsistency Repair to tackle different replicas not being consistent with each other (due to eventual consistency). We have a monitoring tool that runs periodically and ensures that all replicas eventually receive all updates.\r\n\r\n# Compiling\r\nThe project can be compiled using the folloing commands.\r\n\r\n1) Compiling the Node\r\n\r\n    g++ -o node Node.cpp ConfigReader.cpp SocketBroker.cpp MessageHandler.cpp Storage.cpp -pthread -std=c++11\r\n    \r\n2) Compiling the Server\r\n\r\n    g++ -o server Server.cpp ConfigReader.cpp SocketBroker.cpp MessageHandler.cpp Storage.cpp -pthread -std=c++11\r\n","google":"UA-64630830-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
